# Details About Standard Parts

*For details about construction please refer to the construction documentation (**realant-auxiliary/docs/construction.md**).*

The body assembly of the robot serves two purposes. Firstly, it provides a structural element connecting the four leg assemblies. Secondly, it houses the electronics that power and control the actuators.

The general idea of the original body structure was kept with the new design. With the new design,the plates have similar attachments for the actuators, similar curves on the outer edges, and the actuator cables run through similar holes. However, unlike the original plates, the new design uses different parts for the top and bottom plates. This was required due to the addition of an access hatch and component mounting structures. The new design also adds parts for covering the hatch and attaching optional motion tracking markers.
